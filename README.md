### Next Target Release Version:
Draft 1

## How to Use
### Installation
You can install the sytem using the latest manifest file, found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/walcutt/hench/refs/heads/develop/system.json).

### Gameplay
- Make sure to add a deck in the cards section, using one of the presets.
- You can edit the deck:
  - With new images
  - With new cards
  - With new cues
- Drawing cards adds them to the "spread". Clicking a card that is held, or in the spread, will play it. If you play a card from the spread, the others are sent to the bottom of the deck.
- Make sure to give your players "Owner" access to the deck so they can use it! Even with that, only GMs can edit the deck.
